        'H. G. Wells wrote <em>The War of the Worlds</em> in 1898, when there was much speculation about life on the planet Mars. The book is considered to be one of the first science fiction novels.  In the story, an English gentleman narrates the events of a violent and fast paced Martian invasion.</p>\n<p>The frightening images of people fleeing from gigantic tripod machines and the prospect of life under Martian rule have served as a bottomless well of inspiration for popular culture.  The novel has served as a template for many derivative or inspired works, including comics, countless books, a tv series, several films, a bestselling musical, and the famous Orson Wells broadcast. Overall, <em>The War of the Worlds</em> has become an early milestone in and inspiration for the invasion genre.</p>\n<p>The novel demonstrates Wells\' typical pessimistic outlook on human nature and offers a good deal of critisism on society and people\'s ignorance and vanity. <em>The War of the Worlds</em> can be read as an indictment of European colonial actions around the globe at that time - with which the injustice of the Martian invasion can be compared.  Wells has since been credited with predicting quite a number of technologies, such as laser-like rays, industrial robot-like machines, and chemical-warfare.<br />(Summary by Stephan Möbius and Annie Coleman)</p>\n<p><b>Illustrations by </b><a href="http://librivox.org/reader/91">Stephan Möbius</a></b><br>\nBook 1 - Chapter 1: <a href="http://archive.org/details/waroftheworlds_illustrations_librivox/00_chapter00__map_of_surrey.gif">Map of Surrey</a><br>\nBook 1 - Chapter 5: <a href="http://archive.org/details/waroftheworlds_illustrations_librivox/01_chapter04__the_cylinder_opens.gif">The Cylinder Opens - 1</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/waroftheworlds_illustrations_librivox/02_chapter04__the_cylinder_opens_2.gif">The Cylinder Opens - 2</a><br>\nBook 1 - Chapter 11: <a href="http://archive.org/details/waroftheworlds_illustrations_librivox/03_chapter10__in_the_storm.gif">In the Storm</a><br>\nBook 1 - Chapter 12: <a >At the Window</a><br>\nBook 1 - Chapter 16: <a href="http://archive.org/details/waroftheworlds_illustrations_librivox/05_chapter15__what_had_happened_in_surrey.gif">What Had Happened in Surrey</a><br>\nBook 1 - Chapter 17: <a href="http://archive.org/details/waroftheworlds_illustrations_librivox/06_chapter16__the_exodus_from_london.gif">The Exodus from London</a><br>\nBook 2 - Chapter 2: <a href="http://archive.org/details/waroftheworlds_illustrations_librivox/07_chapter18__under_foot.gif">Under Foot</a><br></p>\n\n\n',

  bkDescription:
    "Do remember reading a panic-mongering news story a while back about genetically engineered “Frankengrass” “escaping” from the golf course where it had been planted? That news story was foreshadowed decades previously in the form of prophetic fiction wherein a pushy salesman, a cash-strapped scientist, and a clump of crabgrass accidentally merge forces with apocalyptic consequences. A triple-genre combo of science fiction, horror, and satire, Greener Than You Think is a forgotten classic that resonates beautifully with modern times. This is a faithful reading of a 1947 first edition text. (Summary by Lee Elliot)",
